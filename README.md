# Keep Calm and Don't laugh

A recent YouTube trend brought to your laptops using Microsoft Cognitive services. Make a Youtube playlist (or use the default one),
grab a couple of friends and try to find out who has the worst sense of humour. 

How to run:
 - Clone repository
 - Run via Python3 (Tested on Python 3.6 x86 on Windows 10)
 - Install dependencies (opencv-python, numpy, pillow, urllib, pytube, pprint, ffmpy, bs4, vlc, pygame)
 - Run main.py with an optional argument for a Youtube playlist URL.
 - Have fun trying not to laugh at Wednesday memes
